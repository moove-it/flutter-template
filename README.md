<h1 align="center">Flutter Boilerplate Template</h1>
<h3 align="center">A solid and easy-to-use template to quickstart your next Flutter project</h3>


## ‚ö° Introduction
FlutterMoove is a powerful Flutter boilerplate, created by Moove It, that provides the basis for rapidly bootstrapping the development of your mobile application.
For typical applications, by using FlutterMoove, you can significantly reduce the time to start a project ‚Äì and ultimately the time it‚Äôll take a business to see an app go live. 
This is because we already have a tested starting point. This means we have aspects such as the libraries defined and the folder structure already established.

## ‚≠ê What's inside
- Built with the latest major version of Flutter (and we'll keep it updated!)
- Three screens with common widgets and navigation
- Authentication-based route resolver
- Multi-language support
- Built-in dark mode and multi-theme with pixel-density-aware widget sizing
- Ready for CI testing with Github Actions
